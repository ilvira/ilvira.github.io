message: "\"Conferences are a WASTE of money\" \r\n\"Business leaders avoid the conference sales floor\" \r\n\"Speed dating with executives at conferences does NOT work!\" \r\n \r\nYesterday, I was scrolling through my feeds and I came across a post. It was one of the \"guru\" conference organisers asking a question \"What kind of executives attend conferences?\" \r\n \r\nSo, I scrolled down into the hundreds of comments and to my shock, the comments were as per what I wrote above. \r\n \r\nIt seems that the only way the \"gurus\" understand how to generate C Suite business connections is by spending tens of thousands of dollars to stand at a conference and hoping for the best. \r\n \r\nSo, I jumped in and said...\"Well if you want ROI, we have clients who spend between $1000 to $10,000 for senior business leader connections and one client recently closed a 7 figure cybersecurity deal.\" \r\n \r\nDo you know what happened next? We were flooded with messages of \"How does it work?\" \"Can you show me how?\" \r\n \r\nClearly, even after the conferences, there are still many sales and marketing teams that are desperate to get in front of decision makers to tell their story. \r\n \r\nIf you want to know how they did it - join us  https://www.meetmagic.org/join-individual"
