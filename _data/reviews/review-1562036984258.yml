message: "Hi there, I just visited linguaplaysydney.com.au and thought I would reach out to you. \r\n \r\nI run an animation studio that makes animated explainer videos helping companies to explain what they do, why it matters and how they're unique in less than 2 minutes. \r\n \r\nYou can take a look at some of our work here: \r\nhttp://bit.ly/306h8rr - what do you think? \r\n \r\nI really wanted to make you a super awesome animated video explaining what your company does and the value behind it. \r\n \r\nWe have a smooth production process and handle everything needed for a high-quality video that typically takes us 6 weeks to produce from start to finish. \r\n \r\nFirst, we nail the script, design storyboards you can’t wait to see animated. Voice actors in your native language that capture your brand and animation that screams premium with sound design that brings it all together. \r\n \r\nOur videos are made from scratch and designed to make you stand out and get results. No templates, no cookie cutter animation that tarnishes your brand. \r\n \r\nIf you’re interested in learning more, please get in touch on the email below: \r\nEmail: storybitevideos@gmail.com \r\n \r\nI hope to hear back from you."
