message: "Good day to you, \r\nI am Mr. Juan Alejandro Perez, a Spanish lawyer. I have previously sent you an email regarding a transaction of $13.5 million left by my late client before his tragic death. \r\nI am contacting you once again because after going through your profile, I strongly believe that you will be in a better position to execute this business transaction with me. Please if you are interested to proceed with me kindly respond to my email urgently for more detail information. \r\nThis transaction is 100% risk free and 10% of the total fund will be donated among charity organizations while the remaining will be shared equal by the both of us upon a successful conclusion of the fund transfer to your nominated Bank account. Please advice urgently. \r\nYours Faithfully, \r\nBr. juan Alejandro Perez \r\nTel: +34 919 017 821 \r\nEmail: info@japlawfirm.com"
